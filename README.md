Senior Site Reliability Engineer specializing in security. I build simple, resilient systems to do things that need doing.

All of my work is done in a private account, so activity here is only when work and life allows me time.

### Simple Thoughts

Me love [Grug brained development](https://grugbrain.dev/). Complex systems create complex problems, which lead to more complex "fixes".

Solutions should be as simple as possible. Simple is not the same as easy; simple can be hard work.

I like to think I am pragmatic enough to admit when a complex problem actually demands a complex solution, but I will grumble about it the entire time.
